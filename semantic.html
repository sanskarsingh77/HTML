    <!-- ****** semantic tags******* -->
    <!-- semantic tags are the tags that has meaning  - like form ,article,footer,header,figure,figcaption,main,nav etc -->
    <!-- div ,span are not semantic tags -->
    <!--section define section in your document  -->
    <!-- article is independent text -->
    <!-- section ke andar article laga sakte hai aur article ke andar section use ke sakte ho -->
     <!-- header tag are used at the introductory part of web docs -->
    <!-- difference between header tag and h1 tag by an example 
    I would explain this by an example. A lion living in a jungle marks its territory and no other male is allowed to rule there.
     In the same way, tag is a territory where the header information is put and tag is used to highlight the lion i.e the important statement,
      title , etc. -->
        <!-- Also we can't use header tag in foooter tag as its not a good practice -->
        <!-- CAN WE USE MUTIPLE HEADER AND FOOTER TAGS  
        Yes, but with a catch. The W3 documents state that the tags represent the header and footer areas of their nearest ancestor section. 
            I would recommend having as many as your want, but only 1 of each for each "section" of your page, i.e. body, section etc.-->
     <!-- footer tag is used for information about the web docs LIKE COPYRIGHT POLICY REFUND POLICY AUTHOR ETC in foot -->
    <!--nav tag me navigation links hote hai like   -->
    <!-- BODY AUR MAIN TAG ME DIFFERENCE 
    BODY ME ACTUAL CONTENT HOTA HAI HEADER FOOTER KE SATH ME 
AUR MAIN ME HEADER AND FOOTER CHOD KE SAB HOTA HAI-->
